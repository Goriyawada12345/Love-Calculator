# ❤️ Love Calculator – Python Tkinter GUI Application

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Love Calculator** is a fun and interactive **Python desktop application** built using **Tkinter**, Python’s standard GUI library. This application allows users to enter their name and their partner’s name and then calculates a **random love percentage** to show how compatible they are.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate **basic GUI development**, **event handling**, and **random number generation** using Python in a simple and engaging way.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project was created to:

* Practice **Python GUI programming**
* Learn how to handle **user inputs and button events**
* Understand how to use **random number generation**
* Build a real, interactive desktop application

It is a beginner-friendly project that shows how Python can be used to create graphical applications instead of just console programs.

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** (GUI framework)
* **Random module**

---

## 📋 How the Application Works

1. The program opens a **GUI window** sized at 400×240 pixels.
2. The user is asked to:

   * Enter **their name**
   * Enter **their partner’s name**
3. After clicking the **“Calculate”** button:

   * The application generates a **random two-digit number (00–99)**
   * This number represents the **love percentage**
4. The result is displayed on the screen as the **Love Percentage between both of you**

---

## ⚙️ Features

* Simple and clean user interface
* Two input fields for names
* One-click **Calculate** button
* Random love percentage generator
* Real-time result display

---

## 🧠 Core Logic

The love percentage is generated using Python’s `random.sample()` function.
The code picks **two random digits (0–9)** and joins them to form a two-digit number, which is displayed as the result.

This makes the app:

* Fast
* Fun
* Different every time

## 🖥️ GUI Components Used

* `Tk()` → Main application window
* `Label` → For headings, instructions, and result
* `Entry` → For user name input
* `Button` → To trigger love calculation
